## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Architecture Decisions
- **Python Prototyping**: Confirmed as primary development approach before Godot implementation
- **Data-Driven Design**: All game content will be JSON-defined for easy balancing
- **Event-Driven Effects**: EventBus system approved for decoupling combat logic from effects

### Design Considerations
- **Pierce Ratio Balance**: Need to ensure pierce provides meaningful counterplay without dominating
- **Critical Hit Tiers**: Rarity-based crit scope creates clear progression incentives
- **DoT Stacking**: Combined refresh model prevents spam while rewarding skill

### Technical Considerations
- **Performance Targets**: Combat calculations must complete in < 1ms per hit
- **Memory Management**: StateManager needs efficient handling of effect stacks
- **Testing Coverage**: Aim for 80%+ coverage on critical combat systems

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Code Style Preferences
- **Clear Naming**: Descriptive variable and function names (e.g., `attack_damage` not `atk_dmg`)
- **Type Hints**: Full Python type annotations for maintainability
- **Docstrings**: Comprehensive documentation for all public functions
- **Modular Functions**: Single responsibility principle for all methods

### Data Structure Preferences
- **Immutable Core Stats**: Base stats treated as immutable, modifications through modifiers
- **Typed Enums**: Use enums for categories (damage types, effect types, rarity tiers)
- **Validation**: All data structures validated on creation/load
- **Serialization**: JSON-compatible structures for save/load functionality

### Development Preferences
- **Test-First**: Write tests before implementation where possible
- **Incremental Development**: Build and test small pieces before integration
- **Documentation Priority**: Update memory bank with significant decisions/changes
- **Simulation-Driven**: Use simulation tools to validate design decisions

## Learnings and Project Insights

### Design Strengths Identified
- **Interlocking Progression**: Level caps tied to rarity creates natural long-term goals
- **Event System Flexibility**: Allows complex skill/item interactions without hardcoded logic
- **Phased Implementation**: Clear roadmap prevents scope creep and maintains momentum
- **Simulation-Driven Development**: Automated testing validates design assumptions before Godot port

### Phase 4 Key Learnings
- **Performance Validation**: Simulation achieved 6993 events/second, exceeding performance targets
- **Test Isolation Challenges**: Complex mocking required for interdependent systems (learned from hanging test fixes)
- **Balance Automation**: Automated damage distribution analysis provides actionable insights
- **Time-Based Simulation**: Delta-time processing enables realistic combat pacing and effect timing

### Potential Challenges Anticipated
- **Balance Complexity**: Multiple interacting systems (pierce, crits, DoTs) require careful tuning
- **Performance Scaling**: Effect stacking and event dispatching must scale to 50+ entities
- **Data Management**: Large item/affix databases need efficient loading and querying
- **Godot Port Complexity**: Python prototype patterns may not directly translate to GDScript

### Key Insights from Design Review
- **Player Agency**: Choice-based rewards on level-up add significant replay value
- **Rarity Meaningfulness**: Higher rarity providing deeper mechanical access (not just stats) is innovative
- **Boss Pacing**: Every 3 floors structure creates satisfying rhythm and milestone density
- **Simulation Validation**: Python prototyping approach successfully validated all core mechanics

### Risk Mitigation Strategies
- **Prototyping First**: Python implementation allows rapid iteration and testing before Godot commitment
- **Modular Architecture**: Independent systems can be developed and tested separately
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Automated tests will catch regressions and validate balance changes
- **Documentation Discipline**: Memory bank ensures knowledge persistence across development sessions
